                <p>Don't fight it, use what happens. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it.</p>

                <p class="formatted-par">Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. A beautiful little sunset. Clouds are free. <span id="formatted-span"> They just float around the sky all day and have fun. </span> We wash our brush with odorless thinner.</p>
                
                <p>I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Let's build an almighty mountain. The least little bit can do so much. Here we're limited by the time we have. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. <strong>All you have to learn here is how to have fun.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around.</p>
        </section>

                <p>Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. <em> It's important to me that you're happy. </em> Just beat the devil out of it. Use your imagination, let it go. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. This piece of canvas is your world.</p>

                <p class="formatted-par">This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Here's something that's fun. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Those great big fluffy clouds. It looks so good, I might as well not stop.</p>
                
                <p>Let your imagination be your guide. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Let's have a nice tree right here. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important.</p>
