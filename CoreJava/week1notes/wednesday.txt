exceptions and exceptions handling
                throwable
    Error                   exceptions


    Error = outside from our controle....
            null pointer, no memory, stackoverflow, cannot do anything

        something that goes so wrong with our code excecution that we either should not or could not do anything to prevent it or about it

        ex. stackoverflow, outofmemory


    exceptions:
        runtime exceptions (unchecked) - null pointer, divide by zero, array index out of bounds
        checked exceptions: File not found, IO exception, servlet exception, sql exception


    unchecked excceptions: exception that with good coding practices would be prevented, so complier will not insist we handle them.
                          These are runtime exceptions is not the only type of excceptions at runtime.
    
    checked exceptions: Exceptions generally involving something outside of the developer controle


    handling exceptions

    try {
        //some code
    } catch(error// Exception e) {

    } catch (FileNotFoundException e1) {

    } finally 

    add a throw clause to a method 

    public void method1() throws Exception {
        method2() 
    }

    public void method2() throws Exception{
        throw new Exception()
    }

    CUSTOM Exceptions
     
    public class MyCoolExperience extends Exception {

    }
